# Visual and Semantic Similarity with Redis

This demo goes along with the [Announcement of a New Redis Vector Similarity Search](https://redis.com/blog/build-intelligent-apps-redis-vector-similarity-search/)

You will experiment with two key applications of Vector Similarity Search application using a realistic dataset:

* Semantic Search: Given a sentence check products with semantically similar text in the product keywords
* Visual Search: Given a query image, find the Top K most "visually" similar in the catalogue

# About the Amazon Product dataset
The CSV product data used in this demo was derived from the ["Amazon Berkeley Objects Dataset"](https://amazon-berkeley-objects.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html)

Each row in the CSV file correspond to a product in the original dataset.


# Before you start
* Install [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/)
    * Make sure you initialize LFS by runing
    ```sh
    git lfs install
    ```
* Docker
* [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

# Clone the Repo
```sh
git clone https://github.com/RedisAI/vecsim-demo.git
```
# Fire Up the Docker containers
Use `docker compose` to start up 2 containers:
* vesim: A redis container with Vector Similarity Search (VSS) on port 6379
* jupyter: A python notebook server on port 8888 pre-loaded with 4 notebooks
    * 2 notebooks illustrating how to perform Visual Similarity with Redis VSS
    * 2 notebooks illustrating how to perform semantic Similarity with Redis VSS
```sh
cd vecsim-demo
docker compose up
```
**NOTE**: The first time you run the above command, it will take 5-10 minutes (depending on your network)
The jupyter container downloads a 3.25GB tar file with product images from the ["Amazon Berkeley Objects Dataset"](https://amazon-berkeley-objects.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html)

# Launch the Jupyter Notebooks
Monitor the logs and look out for the link to launch jupyter on your local machine
![copy the URL](./docs/jupyter-log.png)
Or run the following:
```sh
jupyter notebook
```

# Step 1: Semantic Similarity - Part I
Open this notebook [http://127.0.0.1:8888/notebooks/SemanticSearch1k.ipynb](http://127.0.0.1:8888/notebooks/SemanticSearch1k.ipynb)

Run All Cells and check the outputs

You will generate embeddings for 1,000 products and perform semantic similarity using two indexing methods(HNSW and brute-force)

# Step 2: Semantic Similarity - Part II
Open this notebook [http://127.0.0.1:8888/notebooks/SemanticSearch100k.ipynb](http://127.0.0.1:8888/notebooks/SemanticSearch100k.ipynb)

Run All Cells and check the outputs

You will load ~100k previously-generated embeddings for the first 100,000 products in the dataset.
You'll perform semantic similarity on a larger dataset

# Step 3: Visual Similarity - Part I
Open this notebook [http://127.0.0.1:8888/notebooks/VisualSearch1k.ipynb](http://127.0.0.1:8888/notebooks/VisualSearch1k.ipynb)

Run All Cells and check the outputs

You will generate embeddings for 1,000 product images and perform visual similarity using two indexing methods

# Step 4: Visual Similarity - Part II
Open this notebook [http://127.0.0.1:8888/notebooks/VisualSearch100k.ipynb](http://127.0.0.1:8888/notebooks/VisualSearch100k.ipynb)

You'll perform visual similarity on a larger dataset using two indexing methods (HNSW and brute-force)

# Stop the Docker containers
```sh
docker compose down
```

# About the Amazon Product data
The dataset used in this demo was derived from the ["Amazon Berkeley Objects Dataset"](https://amazon-berkeley-objects.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html)

In particular, each long text field in the product_data.csv was extracted from the original JSON encoded object representing each product.
